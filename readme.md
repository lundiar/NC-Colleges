This map uses data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_North_Carolina) to place the datapoints representing each college. The data points are then color coded by the type of control the college is under: Public, Private, or Community. [NC One Map] (https://www.nconemap.gov/datasets/9728285994804c8b9f20ce58bae45899/explore) provided the GeoJSON for the county polygons and the population data was collected from [North Carolina Demographics] (https://www.northcarolina-demographics.com/counties_by_population). This map uses a Leaflet plug-in for the basemap and for style functions.
